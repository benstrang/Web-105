    <h1>Star Wars Battlefront 2</h1>

    <!--I wonder why they call it floating?-->

    <h2>Launch</h2>
    <p> <strong>Star Wars Battlefront 2</strong> was a highly anticipated release. The last "good" star wars game was
        the <strong>Star Wars Battlefront 2</strong> from the year 2005, this was released on the PS2 so we've been
        waiting awhile for a good star wars game to be released again.The launch of the game was very successful. The
        game was alive for a couple months before slowly dying off as EA added in a loot crate system making the game
        purely pay to win. As of recently, the game has been completely rethought, loot crates removed; new heroes and
        villains added; and as far as player base goes, they've passed up their initial launch numbers. Which is
        incredible for a game thats 3 years old.</p>
    <p>There was a remake of the original battlefront but it just didn't live up to the hype. Battlefront 2, however,
        has definitely captured the Star Wars
        feel that we've all been waiting for. </p>

    <h2>Story Mode</h2>
    <p>"Told over 13 chapters, the story follows Iden Versio, commander of the Empire’s elite Inferno Squad, and starts
        with her just moments before the
        climax of Return of the Jedi. She’s on a mission to destroy evidence that would warn the Rebels about the
        Empire’s secret attack near Endor, and
        after pulling that off she’s sent to run a mission on the forest moon — where she sees the second Death Star
        blown apart. Her father, an Imperial
        Admiral, brings her in to help initiate the last directive from The Emperor — something called Operation:
        Cinder,"

        I'll try to not spoil the story incase one of you decides to pick up the game, but it brings back the same
        nostalgia from our favorite heroes and
        villians in the star wars galaxy and also adds some detail to back stories of some heroes.</p>

    <!--I had to use a quote for the story because I couldn't remember what was or wasn't a spoiler-->

    <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
    <p>The multiplayer for battlefront follows the same theme as the previous games but with the added features and
        modes. The three most popular game
        modes include Walker Assualt; Supremacy; amd Turning Point. All of these modes are 40 vs 40 and take place on
        your favorite Star Wars planets.
        There's also a heroes vs villains mode, this mode is 4 vs 4. One side will be villains and one side will be
        heroes. A typical line up for this
        gamemode would be Darth Vader, Darth Maul, Palpatine, and Kylo Ren for the villains, and then for the Heroes,
        Luke, Anakin, Obi Wan, and Han.
        You aren't limited to this these four, there's around 10 characters for each side to choose from. There's also a
        very similar mode, except
        you are picking from the heroes or villains fighter pilots. Then you fly around the place trying to shoot each
        other down.</p>
